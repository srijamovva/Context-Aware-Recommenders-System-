# Context-Aware-Recommenders-System-
This project studies Context-Aware Recommender Systems using deep learning models like NCF, NeuMF, and NeuCMF. We evaluate multiple context representation strategies, including PCC and neural embeddings, on TripAdvisor and Frappe datasets, showing that individual context embeddings improve recommendation accuracy.
